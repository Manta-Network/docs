Staking rewards work the following way:

1. On every produced block, ~7.6 MANTA are created (equivalent to 2% of total issuance per year)
2. This reward is allocated for later payout in the following way
    - 10% of this reward go to the collator that produced it to compensate for collator running expenses
    - The remaining 90% is split proportionally to MANTA staked between everyone who delegated to this collator (this includes a collatorâ€™s self-bond)
3. Three *rounds* later ( max. 18 hours ), the rewards accumulated in this way are paid out automatically, directly to the addresses of the collator and every delegator
