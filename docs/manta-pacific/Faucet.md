Manta Pacific chains include a built-in crypto faucet that allows users to easily acquire and test the native cryptocurrency of the chain. This feature is designed to make it easy for developers, testers, and new users to obtain small amounts of cryptocurrency and use it to explore the functionality and features of the blockchain.
The faucet feature is typically configured to dispense small amounts of cryptocurrency to users who request it, allowing them to test the functionality of the chain without having to make a purchase.
The crypto faucet feature is a valuable tool for developers who are building applications on top of the chain, as it allows them to test their applications with real cryptocurrency without incurring any financial risk. Additionally, it is a great way for new users to get started with the blockchain and familiarize themselves with its features and functionality.
