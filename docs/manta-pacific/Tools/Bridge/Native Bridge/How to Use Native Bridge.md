- Make sure you have enough tokens to pay gas fees: MANTA in your Manta Atlantic wallet, and ETH in your Manta Pacific wallet. If you don’t have an Atlantic wallet yet, you can download a compatible wallet such as the Manta Wallet. Once you have your Atlantic wallet, you can use the address located in it.
- Bridge $MANTA from Manta Pacific to Manta Atlantic by using the Manta Bridge.
- Connect both your Atlantic wallet (e.g., Manta Wallet) and your Pacific wallet (e.g., MetaMask) on cBridge. Then, select the token you are bridging (i.e., $MANTA) and enter the amount you want to bridge.
- Approve the transaction to initiate the transfer process.
