Manta Pacific chain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing them to run standard Ethereum smart contract code without modification or recompilation. This compatibility means that Manta Pacific work seamlessly with a wide range of existing Ethereum tooling, including:
- General-purpose libraries like Ethers.js and Web3.js
- Developer tools like Hardhat and Foundry
- Popular wallets like Metamask

This makes it easy for developers to build and deploy smart contracts, using the same tools and techniques they are already familiar with. Additionally, this compatibility ensures that existing Ethereum-based dApps can be easily ported to Manta Pacific with minimal modifications, providing a wide range of use cases and opportunities for developers to create new decentralized applications.
