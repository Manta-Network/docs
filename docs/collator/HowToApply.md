#  üë©üèº‚Äçüíª How to apply to run a Calamari collator?

## Hardware requirement

a. If running on your own machine, hardware requirement, internet bandwidth (we prefer collators with private node for better decentralization).
    
```jsx
    cpu:8 cores
    memory: 32 GB of ram
    disk space: 500 GB of disk space dedicated to the blockchain basepath
    bandwidth: 100 Mbps+
    internet-accessible ports: 30333 30334
```
    
b. If running on AWS/Azure/GCP (or other cloud provider), please use an instance type with similar configuration to the following:
    
```jsx
    AWS instance: Ubuntu 20.04 (use the latest ubuntu server ami from canonical)
    disk space: r5ad.xlarge
    recommended region: EU or US
```
    
Note: 
- A calamari collator utilizes up to 27gb of ram on a 32gb system.
- A calamari collator utilizes up to 25% of cpu on a 24 core system.
- A reliable internet connection as well as uninterruptible power supply which should keep the machine and network **permanently online**.
