### Bonding requirement

An amount of KMA must be bonded and is not transferable whilst collating. This amount should be present as a transferable balance within the collator account at the time that the `joinCandidates` extrinsic is run.

The current candidacy bond amount can be checked on the [calamari chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.calamari.systems%2F#/chainstate) &gt; collatorSelection &gt; candidacyBond(): u128.

Run the `joinCandidates` [extrinsic](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.calamari.systems%2F#/extrinsics) in a browser.
