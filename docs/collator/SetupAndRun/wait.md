## ‚è≥ Wait

Ensure you have completed the [collator application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScizDDMq7jWeOPVVEMr3EY_Z6N6ugdkL8aKgAbZ9lAJX6DEOQ/viewform) form. If approved, Calamari council will submit a motion to promote you as a candidate.

:::note
Candidate doesn‚Äôt mean your node is collator. For example, if there are 3 candidate places, and other candidates occupy all places, whilst you‚Äôre in 4th position, you have to wait until a node is unregistered or new collator places are opened by the council.
:::

If your collator gets a place, two sessions (`12` to `24` hours) after the candidacy motion passes, you will see blocks produced by your collator in the [explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.calamari.systems%2F#/explorer).
