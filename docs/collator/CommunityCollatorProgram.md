# ðŸ§©  Community Collator Program

We would like to invite you to join the community collator program, in order to make Manta/Calamari more decentralized and more secure. Currently, Calamari collators program's application is open.

## Collator runner incentives

We would imagine we can reach 10 Calamari collators end of Q1 2022, and 20 collators in Q2. So based on this estimation, we set the initial bonding requirement of running collator to `400_000 KMA`. Collator runners will take 60% of transaction fees plus 100% of tips. The remaining 40% of transactions fees goes back to the treasury.

By running Calamari collators, your future Manta collator application will also be **prioritized**.
