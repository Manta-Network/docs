# Overview

zkShuffle Contracts provide two contract interfaces to help developers build their own card games:
- [IShuffleStateManager](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/IShuffleStateManager.sol): The manager of shuffle state machine, which creates and registers shuffle state, deals and opens cards.
- [IBaseGame](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/IBaseGame.sol): Developers need to inherit this interface when writing their own game contracts.


# IShuffleStateManager

### createShuffleGame

```function createShuffleGame(uint8 numPlayers) external returns (uint256)```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L161-L163)

Creates a new game and returns the game ID of the newly created game.
This could only be called by game contract.

**Parameters:**
- ```numPlayers```: The number of players.

**Return:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.

**Example:**
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;
import "IBaseGame.sol";
import "IShuffleStateManager.sol";
contract Game is IBaseGame {
    IShuffleStateManager public shuffle;
    constructor(IShuffleStateManager _shuffle) {
        shuffle = _shuffle;
    }
    function createGame() external {
        uint256 shuffleId = shuffle.createShuffleGame(2);
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### register

```function register(uint256 gameId, bytes calldata next) external```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L210-L217)

Enters the register state, which can only be called by the game owner.

**Parameters:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.
- ```next```: The calldata that contains the function signature and parameters, and it will be executed in the next invocation.

> **Note:** The ```gameId``` parameter in all the interfaces corresponds to the return value of the ```createShuffleGame``` function.

> **Note:** ```register``` only initiate the registration phase so that players can register, it doesn't actually perform the registration.

### playerRegister

```function playerRegister(uint256 gameId, address signingAddr, uint256 pkX, uint256 pkY) external returns (uint256)```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L228-L233)

Performs the registration for a certain player, which can be called by game contract or directly called by user.

**Parameters:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.
- ```signingAddr```: The signing address of the player, usually it's player's metamask address.
- ```pkX```: The X-coordinate of the public key generated by BabyJub curve. It can be generated by SDK
- ```pkY```: The Y-coordinate of the public key generated by BabyJub curve. It can be generated by SDK

**Return:**
- ```pid```: The player index in the game.

> **Note:** If you don't have special needs, it's better to use SDK to do the registering.

**Example:**
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;
import "IBaseGame.sol";
import "IShuffleStateManager.sol";
contract Game is IBaseGame {
    IShuffleStateManager public shuffle;
    uint256 public shuffleId;
    constructor(IShuffleStateManager _shuffle) {
        shuffle = _shuffle;
    }
    function createGame() external {
        shuffleId = shuffle.createShuffleGame(2);
    }
    function registerGame(uint256 pkX, uint256 pkY) external {
        bytes memory next = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            this.dummy.selector
        );
        shuffle.register(shuffleId, next);
        uint256 playerIdx = shuffle.playerRegister(
            shuffleId,
            msg.sender,
            pkX,
            pkY
        );
        ...
    }
    function dummy() external {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### shuffle

```function shuffle(uint256 gameId, bytes calldata next) external```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L280-L283)

Initiates the shuffle phase, which can only be called by game contract.

**Parameters:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.
- ```next```: The calldata that will be executed in the next invocation.

> **Note:** ```shuffle``` only initiate the shuffle phase so that players can shuffle, it doesn't actually perform the shuffle.

### dealCardsTo

```function shuffle(uint256 gameId, BitMaps.BitMap256 memory cards, uint256 playerId, bytes calldata next) external```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L332-L337)

Specifies a set of cards to be dealed to a players, which can only be called by game contract.

**Parameters:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.
- ```cards```: The cards to deal.
- ```playerId```: The player index in the shuffle game.
- ```next```: The calldata that will be executed in the next invocation.

> **Note:** ```dealCardsTo``` only initiate the dealing phase so that players can deal, it doesn't actually perform the dealing.

> **Note:** ```cards``` is represented in bitMap. For example: if the data of ```cards``` is 28, it corresponds to the binary representation 11100. This means that the cards with indexes [2, 3, 4] need to be dealt.

### openCards

```function openCards(uint256 gameId, uint256 playerId, uint8 openningNum, bytes calldata next) external```[[src]](https://github.com/manta-network/zkShuffle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/shuffle/ShuffleManager.sol#L477-L482)

Specifies a player to open a number of cards, which can only be called by game contract.

**Parameters:**
- ```gameId```: The created shuffle game ID.
- ```playerId```: The player index in the shuffle game.
- ```openningNum```: The number of cards that the player wants to open.
- ```next```: The calldata that will be executed in the next invocation.

```register``` ```shuffle``` ```dealCardsTo``` ```openCards```, these four functions all specify ```next``` as the next operation to be executed, but their execution timing is different.
| function | when ```next``` will be called |
|:--------|:--------|
| register | after all the players have registered |
| shuffle | after all the players have shuffled the deck |
| dealCardsTo | after all the players except for the one with the ```playerId``` have dealt cards |
| openCards | after each player has opened cards |

**Example:**
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;
import "IBaseGame.sol";
contract Game is IBaseGame {
    // This indicates that the game contract is based on a deck of 30 cards.
    function cardConfig() external pure override returns (DeckConfig) {
        return DeckConfig.Deck30Card;
    }
    ...
}
```
