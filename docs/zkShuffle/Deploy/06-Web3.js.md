# Web3.js

## What is Web3.js?

Web3.js is a collection of tools that enable programmers to communicate with Ethereum nodes through HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket protocols using JavaScript. Caldera has a similar API, which can be used with the same JSON RPC calls as Ethereum, allowing developers to utilize the Web3.js library to interact with a Caldera node as if it were Ethereum.

## Getting Started with Web3.js

1. Create a JavaScript Project to store all of the files you'll be creating
   `mkdir web3-examples && cd web3-examples`
2. Install the Ethers.js library and the Solidity compiler
   `npm install web3 solc@0.8.0`
3. Setup Web3.js with Caldera chain

    ``` js
    const Web3 = require('web3');

    // Create Web3 instance
    const web3 = new Web3("RPC URL"); // Insert your RPC URL here
    ```
