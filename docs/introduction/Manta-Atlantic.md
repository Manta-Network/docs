# What is Manta Atlantic (Layer1)?

Manta Atlantic is the fastest and most decentralized ZK Layer1 supporting modular on-chain compliance privacy. Its suite of core products and technologies, including zkNFTs and MantaPay, offers user-friendly access to powerful ZK-enabled use cases.

Compared with those zk privacy layers 1 to build a zk smart contract language, Manta Atlantic is focusing more on the ZK compliance privacy layer with real adoption and interoperability to make other projects have privacy functions without dealing with any cryptography work.

Manta Atlantic uses ZKPs to ensure that transfers are executed according to a structured protocol (circuits) while keeping sensitive information (for example, how much money you send or who you send it to) private. Instead of directly publishing those details on-chain, which would ensure that the protocol has been properly executed but leak all private data, the sensitive bits of information act as witnesses in a ZKP system, namely the SNARK Groth16. Then the Ledger runs the verify function on the resulting ZKP against the public inputs and, if it passes, posts the transaction.

The Mantaâ€™s zk circuit and infrastructure has been developed by two years, it has a public account based address system and an UTXO based private address system, we call it zkAddress. The zkAddress shielded information including sender, receiver, asset ID, and amount. It is the first private address system that is reusable, independent and auditable. Also the first one supports multiple crypto assets/NFTs, which has its own seed phase and can sync on different devices. With Prove Key, users are able to share the certain asset/credential of the zkAddress without leaking privacy.
