# Manta Atlantic

Manta Atlantic is the fastest and most decentralized ZK Layer 1 blockchain, supporting modular on-chain compliance identities. Its suite of core products and technologies—including zkNFTs, staking mechanisms, and ecosystem projects—provides user-friendly access to powerful ZK-enabled use cases.

## ZK Compliant Credentials

Unlike other ZK identity Layer 1 solutions that focus on building ZK smart contract languages, Manta Atlantic prioritizes the ZK compliance credential layer. This approach ensures real-world adoption and interoperability, enabling other projects to integrate interoperable identities without needing to handle complex cryptographic work themselves.

## zkAddress and Other Advanced Infrastructure

Manta’s ZK circuits and infrastructure have been under development for two years. The platform features a public account-based address system alongside a UTXO-based private address system, which we call zkAddress. Here are the key features:

- Privacy Protection: A zkAddress shields sensitive information, including SBT minting, on-chain credentials, and off-chain identities.
- Reusability and Independence: It is the first private address system that is reusable, independent, and auditable.
- Multi-NFT Support: zkAddress is the first system to support multiple NFTs, complete with its own seed phrase functionality that allows synchronization across different devices.
- Selective Disclosure: Using a Prove Key, users can selectively share specific credentials from their zkAddress without compromising their zk identity.
