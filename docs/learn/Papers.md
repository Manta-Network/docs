**Abstract**

We propose Manta, a plug and play private DeFi stack that consists of MantaDAP, a multi-asset decentralized anonymous payment scheme and MantaDAX, an automated market maker(AMM) based decentralized anonymous exchange scheme. Compared with existing privacy preserving cryptocurrencies such as Zcash and Monero,Manta supports multiple base assets and allows the privatized assets to be exchanged anonymously via MantaDAX. We think this is a major step forward towards building a privacy preserving DeFi stack. Thanks to the efficiency of modern NIZKs (non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems) and our carefully crafted design,Manta is efficient: our benchmarks reports a 15 second, off-line zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) generation time, and a 6 millisecond, on-line proof verification time.
