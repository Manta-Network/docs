# Core Protocol Specification

MantaPay protocol defines a flexible private asset protocol that supports fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and soul bound tokens (SBTs). MantaPay allows users to use a permanent address (`zkAddress`) to hold, transfer, and convert to public various blockchain assets with privacy built in (`zkAsset`).
