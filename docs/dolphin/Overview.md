# 📝 Overview

The Dolphin testnet is where we build new and experimental protocols before they are safe to use on [Calamari](../calamari/Overview.md) or [Manta](../manta/Overview.md). Expect things to break and change often when using the testnet.

## 🧪 Current Testnet Features

Dolphin, as well as [Calamari](../calamari/Overview.md), form the test-bed for the Manta ecosystem, operating at different levels of security, stability, and incentives. Dolphin is the most experimental of these test networks and features a number of different experimental features that are studied and thoroughly tested before being added to the Calamari and/or Manta networks.

| Experiment                 | Status (Active/Removed/Design) |
