# 📝 Overview

The Dolphin testnet is where we build new and experimental protocols before they are safe to use on [Calamari](../calamari/Overview.md) or [Manta](../manta/Overview.md). Expect things to break and change often when using the testnet.

To get started with Dolphin, it's a good idea to read more about our [currently active projects](projects/Experiments.md) and the [**Signer**](../signer/Overview.md).
