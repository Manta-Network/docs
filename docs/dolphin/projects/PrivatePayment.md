# ðŸ•¶  Private Payment

Manta is all about bringing privacy to the wider blockchain space, and an important part of making privacy practical to use is the construction of simple and powerful privacy primitives. The first and most powerful primitive we are building is _Private Payment_, more specifcally, a _multi-asset decentralized anonymous payment protocol_.

## How Does It Work?

We recently posted a tech talk that explains the protocol in some detail:

You can follow along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmRChiIDl2A), [download the slides](tech-talk-1-slides.pdf), and/or keep reading below to get an overview and some technical details about how _Private Payment_ works.

Currently, the formal specification for _Private Payment_ is still closed source, but stay tuned for its public release in the near future!
