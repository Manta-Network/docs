# ðŸ§ª Experiments

Dolphin, as well as [Calamari](../../calamari/Overview.md), form the test-bed for the Manta ecosystem, operating at different levels of security, stability, and incentives. Dolphin is the most experimental of these test networks and features a number of different experimental features that are studied and thoroughly tested before being added to the Calamari and/or Manta networks.
