[AsMatch](https://www.asmatch.app/) is the world’s first Web3 SocialFi matching app built for mobile. AsMatch is an innovative Web3 mobile app that combines AI-generated content (AIGC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and zkSBTs powered by [Manta Network](https://manta.network/), and a match-to-earn model with token incentives. The app’s matching engine connects users in Web3 for dating, social networking, professional connections, and making new friends. Dive into the future of online connections with AsMatch — your secure, engaging, and rewarding Web3 matching app.

## Recent Problems with Matching Apps in Web2

In the post-pandemic era, many social activities and habits have changed dramatically. People are switching from offline to online matchmaking. Today, over 8,000 dating sites can be found on the Internet, including Tinder, Badoo, MoMo, Tantan, Hinge, etc. But these Web2 dating sites suffer from major problems such as catfishing, fake profiles, romance scams, and an imbalance between females and males.

Catfishing is the process by which someone lures another unknowing person into a romantic relationship by creating a fake identity (such as fake name, picture, background information, etc.). Today, approximately 10% of users on Web2 dating sites falsify their information, and 57% of users admit that they “embellish” some parts of their profiles. Fake profiles not only adversely affect the overall quality of the dating service but also pose the dangers of financial fraud. [According to the Federal Trade Commission](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9208268), “21,000 online dating scams were reported in 2018, with total reported losses of $143 million.” Swindlers use fake information to monetize from others, and some users also use virtual information to hide their identities to protect themselves. This leads to a vicious cycle that makes it harder for genuinely needy users to successfully find a trustworthy and well-matched partner on the platform.

Romance scams are when someone uses a dating app to trick the victim into thinking they want or have a serious relationship and then uses pickup artist (PUA) techniques to obtain benefits, including but not limited to money. For [example](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a38955743/tinder-swindler-simon-leviev-true-story-where-is-he-now/), someone acted like a diamond millionaire and contacted women on a dating app to trick them into giving him loans. From this romance scams, this person conned more than $10 million. According to the FBI’s Internet [Crime Complaint Center](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/washingtondc/news/press-releases/fbi-cautions-public-to-be-wary-of-online-romance-scams) (IC3), romance scams cause the highest financial losses to victims compared to other Internet crimes. “In 2016, almost 15,000 complaints categorized as romance scams were reported to IC3 (nearly 2,500 more than the previous year), and the losses associated with those complaints exceeded $230 million.” The average amount in 2020 was up to $25,000. The 20–29 age group’s report number increased rapidly, doubling in number between 2019 and 2020.

Last but not least, there is a serious imbalance problem in the ratio of male to female users on most Web2 dating platforms. User data on all platforms is highly skewed towards men. [Tinder](https://financesonline.com/tinder-statistics/), for example, has 75.8% men and only 24.2% women in the US. In other countries, such as India and the UK, the gap is even wider. European dating site Bumble fared slightly better, but the gap between male and female users was still around 15%. In addition, another vicious circle on dating platforms is the message response rate. Normally, women consider more before starting a relationship, so it’s generally harder for them to start a new conversation. [According to the data](https://www.businessinsider.com/online-dating-message-statistics-2013-7), women would need to send 25 messages to a matching man to ensure a reply, while a man would have to send 114 messages.

## Connect with Real & Verified Users

Two components of [AsMatch](https://www.asmatch.app/) can solve the problems of Web2 Matching Apps. AsMatch’s zkSBT with on-chain credentials address problems of fake profiles, lies and catfishing. The app’s wallet-less mobile matching app with a compelling gamified experience through a match-to-earn model with token incentives improves the gender imbalance.

## Leveraging Manta Network for zkSBT: Solving Fake Profiles & Catfishing

_zkSBTs for Private & Verifiable On-chain Identity_

The idea of the soulbound token [(SBT)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) was originally proposed by Vitalik in early 2022 as an NFT that is connected to wallet and untradeable, used as a form of verifiable digital identity. But with normal SBTs, the metadata can be scraped from a public blockchain. By using zkSBTs maintained on [Manta Network](https://manta.network/) and its [zkAddress](https://docs.manta.network/docs/concepts/zkAddress) system, AsMatch can provide a layer of privacy to protect user information linked to the zkSBT. Users can mint AsMatch zkSBTs through [Manta Network’s NFT Private Offering (NPO) Platform](https://medium.com/@mantanetwork/introducing-zksbts-zknfts-and-npo-89a8e6d77a7f). Furthermore, zkSBT credentials can be verified through [Proof Keys](https://docs.manta.network/docs/concepts/proofkey) on mobile apps without the need for any wallet disclosures. This significantly lowers the user friction for users to onboard web3 applications in mobile.

_AI-generated PFPs, Minted on zkSBT_

[AsMatch’s](https://asmatch.medium.com/asmatch.app) zkPortrait is an AI profile picture (PRP) that can be minted on [Manta Network](https://manta.network/)’s zkAddress. You can upload more than three of your PFPs and choose different themes. We are using 6pen.art to generate AI PFPs. The AI PFP data is included inside the metadata of the zkSBT you minted. 6pen.art’s algorithm identifies human faces to generate PFPs, and does not generate faceless PFPs.

_Privacy-enhanced Decentralized IDs (DIDs)_

Besides the AI PFP, the zkPortrait can be used as a privacy-enhanced DID as it is soul-bound and cannot be traded amongst other users.

Besides crypto assets, AsMatch also plans to partner with other third parties to include more social media and verified bios on the zkSBT in the future. All of this information is private but will verify user identity to reduce lies, catfishing and romance scams.

## AsMatch Mobile App: Gamification to Solve Gender Imbalance

_Easy User Onboarding: Proof Keys for Walletless User Experience_

   </div>

AsMatch is a free-to-play mobile app, where users can connect zkSBTs to enhance the experience. For example, by connecting your AsMatch zkSBT to the app, you are able to earn mystery boxes with token incentives and also provide a private, verifiable identity. Through Manta Network’s ZK technology, users can use a Proof Key to verify zkSBT ownership safely and privately in AsMatch App without connecting any wallets. During the process of using the Proof Key, AsMatch will not touch the user’s assets in any form, which maximizes the protection of user privacy while ensuring the security, correctness, and user trust of the platform.

_Gamification to Encourage Gender Balance_

AsMatch also offers a gamified and fun rewards system with aspects including astrology, crypto assets match, mystery boxes, and token incentives. We offer Match-to-Earn and Chat-to-Earn to increase user engagement. Based on matches through astrolabe, Crypto assets, NFT, Crypto, etc, we will give different levels of scores. To encourage gender balance, users can earn tokens as a reward for each chat. Female users earn rewards for sending more messages, while male users pay to send more messages with in-app tokens. Within the application, the token operates in various social scenarios, such as matchmaking, chatting, inviting friends, purchasing Avatars, community building, etc. In this way, AsMatch operates very differently compared to traditional web2 dating applications; existing applications monetize their userbase, whereas AsMatch offers revenue opportunities to token holders.
