# Introducing Proof of My Possessions (POMP): Your Trustless Private Asset Verification Tool

Proof of My Possessions (POMP) is a platform that lets you verify your on-chain activity, assets (including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and SBTs), and other attributes of your web3 identity in a privacy-enhanced manner. You can also use it to verify others’ on-chain information.

Current methods of on-chain verification require users to reveal their wallet addresses, therefore exposing all of their activities, assets, and other miscellaneous information that they would want to keep private. The existing solution for this is to fragment on-chain identity through complicated methods like managing multiple different wallet addresses.

POMP eliminates this issue for all web3 users by giving you a tool that can trustlessly verify your on-chain information to anyone without revealing anything else including your wallet address or other sensitive information.

## The POMP platform provides two features:

## Mint: Generate zkSBTs for Privacy-Preserving Asset Certificates

Pomp’s Mint feature enables users to mint their own asset certificates, known as zero-knowledge Soulbound token (zkSBTs). By connecting their wallets and verifying their assets, users can mint zkSBTs that contain asset information while maintaining privacy.

## Key aspects of the Mint feature include:

1. Unlimited Minting: Users can mint zkSBT certificates at any time, allowing for continuous verification and proof of assets.
2. Time Stamp Integration: Each zkSBT is uniquely time-stamped, providing a chronological record of asset ownership.
3. Versatility Across Chains: zkSBTs can represent ownership stakes in various chains, including BNB, Ethereum, and more in the future.
4. Specific Token Range: Users can mint zkSBTs to showcase ownership of a particular token or a specific range of assets.
5. Privacy-Preserving Approach: POMP enables users to prove their asset ownership without revealing their addresses, ensuring privacy and data protection.

## Search: Confirm User Asset Details Without Revealing Address Information

POMP’s Search feature empowers users to explore and verify proof keys associated with various assets. By simply entering a specific proof key, users gain access to detailed information such as asset value (e.g., 100 ETH) and a time stamp. Crucially, this search functionality ensures privacy by excluding address information, providing users with the ability to showcase their asset ownership without compromising their identity.

## Addressing Asset Verification Challenges

POMP’s innovative approach to asset verification tackles several common challenges in the crypto space:

1. Privacy Concerns: By allowing users to prove their assets without disclosing their addresses, POMP prioritizes user privacy and data security.
2. Secure Sharing: POMP eliminates the need to share sensitive wallet information while enabling easy verification for airdrop claims and compliance as an accredited investor.

## Use cases:
1. Securely Verify Funds Information: Users can utilize POMP’s Mint & Search features to reveal asset details, such as asset value and time stamp, without disclosing their wallet addresses. This enables them to share fund information on social media, maintaining privacy and protecting sensitive information.
2. Proof of Ownerships for NFT: POMP’s Search and Mint features can be used to verify the authenticity and ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Users can mint zkSBTs to prove their ownership or enter the proof key associated with an NFT to validate its ownership and obtain information such as the creator, timestamp, and transaction history, all without revealing their personal wallet address.
3. Participating in Campaigns: By minting zkSBTs, users have the ability to demonstrate their ownership of assets and unlock opportunities to participate in various project campaigns such as whitelists, sales, and airdrops. This innovative approach guarantees the legitimacy of their involvement while maintaining the utmost privacy and confidentiality. With zkSBTs, users can confidently engage in project activities without the need to disclose sensitive information, ensuring a secure and private experience.

**In conclusion**, POMP presents a novel solution to the challenges of asset verification in a privacy-conscious manner. Through its Search and Mint features, POMP empowers users to explore proof keys, mint privacy-preserving asset certificates, and navigate the world of web3 possessions with ease. With POMP, people can confidently prove their crypto assets while keeping their privacy intact, revolutionizing the way we verify digital possessions.
