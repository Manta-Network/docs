# For Developer: Onboard My Project onto the NPO Platform

## Scenario 1: Support zkSBT to identify real users on your app
If you own a mobile app, regardless of whether it is Web2 or Web3, you can connect your API to verify on-chain zkKYCs or zkCredentials on Manta without requiring a wallet connection. This enables you to achieve compliance and protect against sybil attacks without compromising users' privacy data.

**Solution 1**: Integration with Manta's [Proof Key API](https://docs.manta.network/docs/developers/manta.js/how-to-mint-zk-sbt)

**Technical Requirement :** Two Front-End Engineers

**Estimated Time of Arrival:** 2 Working Days

## Scenario 2: Launch your own zkSBT as attestation based on onchain or offchain data
If you are interested in launching your own zkSBT on an NPO platform or your project's frontend, you can launch the zkSBT based on on-chain activities on any chains such as SBT holders, NFT holders, airdrop holders, etc., or off-chain activities such as addresses connected to some Gamefi Apps or identity verification platforms
