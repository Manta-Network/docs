# Manually update your Manta Wallet extension

Your browser should keep extensions up-to-date automatically, but there may be times where a browser did not automatically update your extension.

This can be due to a variety of factors that are outside of the developersâ€™ control. The most common reason is that an update is still in progress of being rolled out to all users by Google.

If you would like to manually check for updates, here's how you can easily check for updates on your extensions:

1. Click on the three dot menu in the top right of your browser, then navigate down to "More tools", followed by clicking on "Extensions".

   <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img alt="view-phrase" src="/img/guides/manta-wallet/update/step1.png" width="50%"/>
   </div>
   This may look slightly different if you are using another browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Arc.

2. At the top right of the page, enable the toggle for "Developer mode". You only need to turn this on temporarily, and it will not affect any of your other extensions or web pages.

   </div>

3. A new set of buttons should have appeared at the left of your screen. Click the button that says "Update", underneath the "Extensions" header at the top left.
   <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
    <img alt="view-phrase" src="/img/guides/manta-wallet/update/step3.png" width="50%"/>
   </div>

4. After you click on this button, wait about 30 seconds. You may see the version number of your extension increase, if there was an update. Once updates have completed, finish the process by turning off "Developer mode" at the top right of the page.

   </div>
