\* -> **NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED**

MANTA staking rewards are managed and distributed by an audited* [staking manager contract (ADD LINK)](TBD) on Ethereum.

Let's look at the specifics of how token rewards get distributed among node operators and token holders.

## Reward Generation and Distribution

- For every block produced on Manta Network, roughly $7.6$ MANTA tokens are created (equivalent to $2\%$ of total issuance per year)
- $10\%$ of this reward goes to the node operator to compensate for infrastructure and other operational expenses.
- The remaining $90\%$ is split proportionally between everyone who has delegated tokens to the operator node. Does this include the self-bond?*
- Rewards are distributed to all the delegator and node operator addresses automatically based on the settlement schedule on Ethereum*.
  
## How are Rewards Calculated

Your staking rewards as a delegator depend on several factors:
- Total amount of MANTA tokens you've delegated
- Performance of the node operator(s) you've chosen
- Your share of the total amount of tokens delegated to your chosen node operator
- Commission rate set by the node operator*

:::tip

- Delegating to reputable node operators with good performance metrics is a good way to maximize your staking rewards
- Rewards don't need to be claimed manually
