**PAGE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AS PER THE LATEST STAKING FLOW - TBD**

Before we begin, please make sure you are familiar with the [Staking Rules for Delegators](../Rules#for-delegators)

When visiting the Staking page for the first time, you will see a pop up appear. Allow polkadot.js access to the dApp

Afterwards, you will be presented with a small pop up that prompts you to enter in the amount you wish to delegate. Simply enter the amount and click the Stake button. Note that there is a minimum amount needed to stake.

Success!
Once the transaction goes through, wait a few moments and you will see that you are now staking your MANTA tokens. 

Rewards are distributed every 6 hours, and you will see the rewards automatically update in the dashboard.
