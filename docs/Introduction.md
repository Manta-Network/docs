Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Manta is a set of protocols built on Substrate that provide anonymous cross-chain interoperability for all Polkadot parachain cryptocurrencies and stable coins. The protocols use zkSNARKS to create end-to-end privacy, and the code is open-source and auditable.

## Our Mission

We at Manta Network believe that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is most valuable because it is permissionless and anti-surveillance. But current services in DeFi do not deliver on privacy, scalability, usability, and liquidity. **We believe that the creation of a stable coin that fully supports anonymity and cross-chain interoperability will give DeFi the chance to overtake the traditional financial industry. That's why we're building Manta Network.**

## Manta Network Overview

Manta's underlying logic is to mint private coins/tokens with stable coins and other base tokens on the contract at a minting value ratio of 1:1. Apart from that, a decentralized private swap platform can support the exchange of these privacy tokens.

The Manta Network is centered around two protocols: **the decentralized private payment protocol** and the **decentralized private token exchange protocol.** Together they enable private versions of coins to be minted at a 1:1 ratio and then privately exchanged on a decentralized platform.

### MantaPay: Privacy Preserving Multi-Asset Decentralized Payment

Is based on zk-SNARK. It allows users to swap Polkadot and its Parachain tokens with corresponding private tokens, pay with privacy tokens, and redeem base coins from private tokens.

### MantaSwap: Privacy Preserving Decentralized Exchange

DAX protocol is based on AMM and zk-SNARK. Users can anonymously trade private versions of tokens on the platform between each other. The price formation method of the decentralized private token exchange protocol is consistent with the mainstream AMM. The revenue model of Manta tokens is based on the rebate and redeem of swap usage fees and transaction fees. In the future, the team will also develop products like synthetic asset stable coins based on Manta.

We also plan to integrate Manta products into decentralized private lending protocols. Decentralized private lending is a decentralized non-custodial lending platform where users can deposit anonymously and borrow private coins on the platform. Decentralized private synthetic asset protocols and other DeFi services are included in the future roadmap.

## Problems solved and application scenarios in Web3 by Manta

Although the current distributed ledger has brought a new payment model without the participation of third-party financial institutions, most records of the current cryptocurrency transactions are publicly available due to the transparency of blockchain technology. Public transactions can be viewed by competitors or third-party organizations, which affects business interests. At an individual level, public transactions can be taken advantage of by advertisers and criminals.

Although privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies such as ZCash exist, the status quo has two significant problems. High price volatility is the first problem, which affects practical use. The lack of scalability is the second problem, which limits use to only simple payments. The exchange of privacy-preserving coins and other cryptocurrencies, including other privacy-preserving coins, is still unsolved â€” that still relies on centralized exchanges and OTC.

Manta Network addresses the above two pain points. First, **the decentralized privacy-preserving payment protocol** based on **zk-SNARK** supports Polkadot and Substrate Parachain assets to their corresponding private pairs. In this way, users can use popular assets like stable coins, renBTC, etc., while simultaneously benefiting from the anonymity of privacy coins.

Our product is currently the only platform that can meet user privacy needs, boost anti-surveillance, and ensure stable private tokens with interoperability. Additionally, the decentralized exchange offers more credibility and security compared to centralized pools by reducing single points of failure.

## Calamari Overview

Calamari is Manta Network's canary net. It's where we release new features before they're added to Manta. Calamari serves the Kusama DeFi world by using zkSNARKs to bring on-chain privacy to transactions and swaps. Like Manta, Calamari Network is centered around two main protocols:

### MariPay

Is a token-agnostic private payment service. MariPay supports the private transfer of Kusama and its Parachain assets, including major crypto assets supported on Kusama. Users can transact popular purchases like stablecoins and wrapped BTC while simultaneously reaping the benefits of on-chain privacy through ZKP.

### MariSwap

Is a private **AMM-based** based DEX. MariSwap offers users the capability of swaps between parachain assets while preserving the privacy of the user addresses. It also provides never-before-seen features in the industry, such as private liquidity pools.

Calamari will be the only platform on Kusama that can meet user on-chain privacy needs, boost anti-surveillance, and ensure private tokens' decentralization and interoperability.
