# What is Manta?

Manta Network is the multi-modular ecosystem designed for building high-performance decentralized applications. The Manta stack delivers a seamless user experience with features such as fast finality and scalable execution.

By combining modular architecture with advanced cryptography, Manta empowers developers to build applications optimized for use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), AI and enterprise-grade solutions for real-world assets and applications.

## Manta Pacific

Manta Pacific is the first modular L2 ecosystem on Ethereum for EVM-native applications requiring high-throughput and cost-effective scalability. Its modular design decouples execution and data availability, enabling developers to deploy Solidity-based dApps with low fees and transaction finality times within mere minutes.
