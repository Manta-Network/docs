Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Manta is a set of easy-to-use and secure (open source and auditable code) protocols based on Substrate frameworks. It uses zk-SNARK to provide complete end-to-end anonymity, high throughput, and high cross-chain interoperability (it supports Polkadot and its parachain mainstream cryptocurrencies and stable coins).

## Our Mission

We at Manta Network believe that DeFi, for now, has its most value in permissionless and anti-surveillance while current services in DeFi have their deficiency in privacy, scalability, usability and liquidity. **Under the current landscape, only when a stable coin that fully supports anonymity and cross-chain interoperability and the relevant DeFi protocol being created can the tremendous value of DeFi be released and deployed, and it is at this point that DeFi will have the chance to overtake the traditional financial industry. That's the reason why we build Manta Network.**

## Manta Network Overview

Mantaâ€™s underlying logic is to mint private coins/tokens with stable coins and other base tokens on the contract at a minting value ratio of 1:1. Apart from that, a decentralized private swap platform can support the exchange of these privacy tokens.

The Manta Network mainly consists of two protocols: **the decentralized private payment protocol** and the **decentralized private token exchange protocol.**

## Products

#### The Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP)

DAP protocol is based on zk-SNARK. It allows users to swap Polkadot and its Parachain tokens with corresponding private tokens, pay with privacy tokens, and redeem base coins from private tokens.

#### The Decentralized Anonymous Exchange (DAX)

DAX protocol is based on AMM and zk-SNARK. Users can anonymously trade private versions of tokens on the platform between each other. The price formation method of the decentralized private token exchange protocol is consistent with the mainstream AMM. The revenue model of Manta tokens is based on the rebate and redeem of swap usage fees and transaction fees. In the future, the team will also develop products like synthetic asset stable coins based on Manta.

We also plan to integrate Manta products into decentralized private lending protocols. Decentralized private lending is a decentralized non-custodial lending platform where users can deposit anonymously and borrow private coins on the platform. Decentralized private synthetic asset protocols and other DeFi services are included in the future roadmap.

#### Problems solved and application scenarios in Web3 by Manta

Although the current distributed ledger has brought a new payment model without the participation of third-party financial institutions, most records of the current cryptocurrency transactions are publicly available due to the transparency of blockchain technology. Public transactions can be viewed by competitors or third-party organizations, which affects business interests. At an individual level, public transactions can be taken advantage of by advertisers and criminals.

Although anonymous cryptocurrencies such as ZCash exist, the status quo has two major problems. High price volatility is the first problem, which affects practical use. The lack of scalability is the second problem, which limits use to only simple payments. The exchange of anonymous coins and other cryptocurrencies, including other anonymous coins, is still unsolved â€” that still relies on centralized exchanges and OTC.

Manta Network addresses the above two pain points. First, **the decentralized anonymous payment protocol** based on **zk-SNARK** supports the exchange of Polkadot and Substrate Parachain assets to their corresponding private pairs. In this way, users can use popular assets like stable coins, renBTC, etc., while simultaneously benefiting from the anonymity of privacy coins.

Second, **a decentralized anonymous exchange protocol** based on **AMM** and **zk-SNARK** can realize decentralized transactions between private coins, which is similar to Uniswap and Curve, and ensure transaction addressesâ€™ **privacy**. Our product is the only platform that can meet user privacy needs, boast anti-surveillance, and ensure private tokensâ€™ stability and interoperability. Also, compared to the centralized dark pool, the decentralized version is more credible and secure, as it reduces single points of failure.

## Manta Network's Kusama Chain Project Calamari

#### About Calamari

Calamari, Manta Networkâ€™s canary-net (the canary-net is an early, highly experimental version of Manta Network, where all new features will be released and tested first), is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation parachain built to service the Kusama DeFi world. It combines Kusama and zkSNARKs to bring on-chain privacy to transactions and swaps. As part of its own suite of products, Calamari Network offers:

#### MariPay

Its token-agnostic private payment service. MariPay supports the private transfer of Kusama and its Parachain assets, including major crypto assets supported on Kusama. Users can transact popular assets like stablecoins and wrapped BTC while simultaneously reaping the benefits of on-chain privacy through ZKP.

#### MariSwap

Its private **AMM-based** based DEX. MariSwap offers users the capability of swaps between parachain assets while preserving the privacy of the user addresses. It also provides never-before-seen features in the industry such as private liquidity pools.

Calamari will be the only platform on Kusama that can meet user on-chain privacy needs, boost anti-surveillance, and ensure private tokensâ€™ decentralization and interoperability.
