Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Manta is a set of protocols built on Substrate that provide anonymous cross-chain interoperability for all Polkadot parachain cryptocurrencies and stable coins. The protocols use zkSNARKS to create end-to-end privacy, and the code is open-source and auditable.

## Our Mission

We at Manta Network believe that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is most valuable because it is permissionless and anti-surveillance. But current services in DeFi do not deliver on privacy, scalability, usability, and liquidity. **We believe that the creation of a stable coin that fully supports anonymity and cross-chain interoperability will give DeFi the chance to overtake the traditional financial industry. That's why we're building Manta Network.**
