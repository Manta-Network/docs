# What is Manta?

Manta Network is the multi-modular ecosystem designed for building high-performance decentralized applications. The Manta stack delivers a seamless user experience with features such as fast finality and scalable execution.

By combining modular architecture with advanced cryptography, Manta empowers developers to build applications optimized for use cases such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), gaming, privacy-preserving transactions, and other enterprise-grade solutions.

**Manta offers two specialized networks**:

-   **Manta Pacific**, the first modular L2 ecosystem on Ethereum for EVM-native applications requiring high-throughput and cost-effective scalability. Its modular design decouples execution and data availability, enabling developers to deploy Solidity-based dApps with low fees and transaction finality times within mere minutes.
-   **Manta Atlantic**, a high-speed L1 chain on Polkadot that introduces programmable, privacy-preserving credentials such as Soulbound tokens enabling decentralized identity and compliance-related use cases. Ideal for applications demanding lightweight on-chain verification and quick consensus.

Together, Manta Pacific and Manta Atlantic deliver an unparalleled experience for for developers to build modular, interoperable dApps that prioritize speed, scalability, and flexibility.

Manta Network was created by a team of experienced founders from prestigious institutions, including Harvard, MIT, and Algorand. Manta Network has received investments from many top web3 investment funds, including Binance Labs and Polychain Capital. It has grown through participation in the best web3 accelerators, including Alliance DAO and Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator. Manta Network is poised to drive adoption of performant, user-centric decentralized applications through modular innovation and cutting-edge cryptography.
