# What is Manta?

Manta is the universal private blockchain platform. We are building a scalable, composable, and private network from first principles. Manta's zero-knowledge cryptography allows developers to build dapps with end-to-end privacy guarantees, which are also interoperable, easy to use, high-performance and auditable. Manta can bring privacy to DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, DAOs, and countless other blockchain applications.

Manta offers two networks:

- [Calamari Network](https://calamari.network/): Manta's canary network. Calamari is running as a Kusama Parachain.
- [Manta Network](https://manta.network/): Manta's Polkadot parachain. Manta is looking forward to joining the Polkadot ecosystem!
