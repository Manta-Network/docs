# Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Manta is the leading on-chain privacy platform for Polkadot and beyond. We are building a better Web 3.0 with privacy guarantees from first principles: applying cutting-edge cryptographic constructions such as zkSNARKs to build blockchain applications, including DeFi, with end-to-end privacy guarantees and at the same time interoperable, easy to use, high performance and auditable tools.

Manta plans to offer two networks:

- [Calamari Network](https://calamari.network/): Manta's canary network. Calamari is running as a Kusama Parachain.
- [Manta Network](https://manta.network/): Manta's mainnet. Manta will be joining the first batch of Polkadot parachain auction!

and a testnet called Dolphin which will run independently of Calamari and Manta.
