# What is Manta?

Manta Network is the multi-modular ecosystem for zero-knowledge (ZK) applications.

**Manta offers two networks**:

-   **Manta Pacific**, the unique L2 ecosystem on Ethereum for EVM-native ZK applications, provides a scalable and inexpensive gas-fee environment for ZK applications to deploy simply using Solidity.
-   **Manta Atlantic**, the fastest ZK L1 chain on Polkadot, brings programmable identities and credentials to web3 through zkSBTs.

Together, Manta Pacific and Manta Atlantic deliver an unparalleled experience for the next generation of web3 application development and adoption with the applied usage of zero-knowledge cryptography.

Manta Network was created by a team of experienced founders from prestigious institutions, including Harvard, MIT, and Algorand. Manta Network has received investments from many top web3 investment funds, including Binance Labs and Polychain Capital. It has grown through participation in the best web3 accelerators, including Alliance DAO and Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator. Manta Network is poised to bring the next generation of web3 users and usher in a new chapter of web3 zkApp applications.
