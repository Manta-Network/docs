# Private Payment

Manta is all about bringing privacy to Web 3.  Supporting privacy in fungible token transfer is essential. The first and most powerful primitive we are building is _Private Payment_, more specifcally, *MantaPay*, a _multi-asset decentralized anonymous payment protocol_. 

Unlike the vast majority of blockchains, fungbile token transfers (i.e. payments) on Manta are shielded by zero-knowledge proofs, and thus private. We illustrate the difference below:

## Bring Your Own Token Privacy

One difference between Manta and ZCash is that Manta supports BYOT (Bring Your Own Token) privacy. Manta boostraps from Polakdot/Kusama ecosystem and supports privatize tokens in DOT/SAMA ecosystem via XCM (Cross Chain Messaging). Manta can privatize more tokens via bridges in the future.
