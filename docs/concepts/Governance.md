# Decentralized Governance

Manta is governed by the community through decentralized governance. Manta (as well as Calamari, Manta's canary network) is delivered feature by feature through [forkless runtime upgrades](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/forkless-upgrades/). Each runtime upgrades goes through the decentralized governance process, which involves decentralized voting on chain using the network's native token ($MANTA on Manta Network and $KMA on Calamari Network).
