# FAQs

## How do I stake my MANTA tokens?

Start by navigating to the [staking dashboard](https://staking.manta.network/), and then choose an active operator of your choice. Follow our [step-by-step guide](./staking-howtos.md).

## Are staking rewards compounded?

No, your staking rewards will not be compounded automatically. Once you claim your rewards to your wallet, you can choose to delegate them manually to an operator. Check out the [How-to guides](./staking-howtos) for help.

## What's the minimum token amount I can delegate to an operator?

There is no lower limit on the token amount you can delegate to an operator.

## Is there an unbonding period for the staked tokens?

Yes. There is a *3 day waiting period* after you unstake your tokens before you can claim them on the [**My Stake**](https://staking.manta.network/my-stake) page.

## Is slashing currently active on the staking layer?

Slashing is not active during the early stages of the staking layer. The operators that fail to contribute in the form of fast finality proofs will simply not receive any rewards.
