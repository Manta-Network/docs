# Overview

We're working with folks at [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi/) on a new secure, decentralized staking solution that enables MANTA token holders to participate in Manta Pacific's network security and earn rewards at the same time.

:::info About Symbiotic

Symbiotic is a decentralized security protocol that enables blockchain networks to access shared security from a pool of staked assets, creating an efficient marketplace for economic security. This helps optimize resource allocation, boosts staking returns for token delegators, and ensures robust security through a flexible, incentive-based design.

We're leveraging Symbiotic's restaking infrastructure to combine Ethereum's security with Manta Pacific's high-performance execution. This increases asset efficiency for MANTA token holders and helps enable [fast finality](../concepts/fast-finality) on Manta Pacific.

## How It Works

Simply put, Manta Pacific nodes opt in to become *operators* on the Symbiotic layer. This allows MANTA token holders on the Manta Pacific chain to natively delegate their tokens to the active node operators.

If you're keen to learn more, we recommend checking out the following docs:

- [Understanding restaking](https://docs.symbiotic.fi/intro/stake)
- [System architecture on Manta Network](../concepts/fast-finality.md#our-two-layer-solution)
- [Reward mechanism - TBD](https://docs.symbiotic.fi)

## Key Benefits of this Architecture

- Added Security for Manta Pacific: The delegated MANTA tokens incentivize operators to honestly verify the state transitions on Manta Pacific, and the validation results are relayed to Ethereum to be settled there.
- Token Rewards: Token delegators and node operators earn MANTA rewards.
- Decentralization: Both fast finality and native MANTA staking are enabled using decentralized infrastructure.

## Get Started

### Become an Operator

If you run a Manta Pacific node and want to join as an operator, refer to the guide below.
