# ðŸ›  Develop on Dolphin

## Introduction

A blockchain app typically consists of a frontend application connecting to and interacting with a blockchain node via RPC or Websocket.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions test to your frontend application by
- creating a non-networked local blockchain node for no-stakes testing, or
- connecting to a node on the live Dolphin Network.

Dolphin is a testnet network to Calamari Network with no economic risk. If you want to use on public network, check our guide to the [Calamari NetWork](DevelopOnCalamari.md).


## Developing against a local blockchain node

This mode of development is recommended to work out your app functionality that does not depend on a long (real-world) history of user transactions as it is
- simple
- local to the developer, so no economic risk involved

### Download Manta Executable

To download an official release of Dolphin, visit our [release page](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta/releases).

### Alternative: Compile Manta Executable

Building your own binary is especially useful if you're not working on a Linux as we don't distribute binaries for Mac/Windows. Furthermore should you need to customize something in your testing environment related to the node, you can rebuild it locally:

1. Clone the specific tag of the Dolphin repository from this URL: `https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta/`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta
cd Manta
```

2. Install Rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

3. Update your PATH environment variable with this command:

```sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

4. To build the binary file, run

```sh
  cargo build --release
```


### Running the Blockchain Node

Running the already compiled node can be done by invoking

```sh
  ./target/release/manta --chain=dolphin-localdev --alice --tmp
```

Alternatively, you can build and run in one step:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --chain=dolphin-localdev --alice --tmp
```

:::note
`dolphin-localdev` exposes the websocket at port 9944 by default, if you need to customize this, you can pass an additional parameter `--ws-port 42069` to use e.g port 42069 instead.
:::

:::note
`dolphin-localdev` eliminates the need for a relay chain and creates a block each time a single transaction is received (but not otherwise)

If you need a more complete blockchain creating blocks periodically like mainnet, you can use substrate ecosystem tools like [zombienet or polkadot-launch](#Development-Tools) and use the `--chain=calamari-local` chainspec when running the nodes instead.

## Connecting With Polkadot-JS

Now that you have a blockchain node to interact with, you need a substrate-compatible wallet API. We'll use `polkdadot.js` for this guide.

1. Open a browser to `https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer`. This opens Polkadot.js Apps, which connects to Polkadot MainNet by default.
2. In the top-left corner, open the menu and navigate to the Development sub-menu.
3. Enter `localhost::9944` under custom endpoint.
4. Click the `Switch` button to connect to your Dolphin development node.

With Polkadot.js Apps connected, your Dolphin development node will be ready to receive transactions and produce blocks, implementing the business logic in e.g. javascript is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Connecting to Dolphin Network

When you need your app to interact with the live network, most of the above still applies, you just connect to a public backend url instead of using your own local blockchain node


## Network Endpoints

List of the load-balancer endpoints provided by Dolphin:

-   WSS - `wss://ws.calamari.seabird.systems`
-   HTTPS - `https://rpc.calamari.seabird.systems`

## Chain ID

Dolphin testnet chain id is `2084`

## Block Explorer

A block explorer is like a search engine for the blockchain. It lets you search for information such as balances, contracts, and transactions.

Subscan is the main block explorer for the Substrate API. It can handle both standard and custom modules, so you can see information about Staking, Governance, and XCM pallets (or modules), among others. The code is open-source and available on the [Subscan Essentials GitHub repo](https://github.com/subscan-explorer/subscan-essentials).

Polkadot.js Apps is another option, especially if you're running local development nodes. It's not a full-featured block explorer, but it lets you view events and query transaction hashes using the WebSocket endpoint. You can easily connect to Moonbeam, Moonriver, or Moonbase Alpha.

## Faucet

To use the Dolphin faucet, head to our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/795390654628102165/1055864933692219453).

To receive tokens from the faucet, you'll need to get the attention of the faucet bot. Start by typing the command for the token you want, such as `/gimme-dol`. Discord will display a small pop-up asking for your wallet address.

Type or paste your wallet address into the address field, then press enter to trigger the faucet request.

You can request each of the four supported tokens (`DOL`, `KAR`, `KSM`, `MOVR`) once per UTC day. If you request the same token twice in the same day, the faucet bot will only respond with the status of your first request of the day. You can check the status of your address at https://faucet.dolphin.community/.

## Development Tools

-   `Manta.js Javascript SDK`: A set of functionality which connects your public address (polkadot-js), your private addresses and manages the creation of the payloads required for `MantaPay` extrinsics.
-   `Manta zkSBT SDK`: A set of functionality that can help you mint zkSBT, store and verify the proof key of zkSBT. To mint zkSBT, you need a Polkadot wallet and Manta Signer. In the future, you can replace Polkadot wallets and Manta Signer with Manta Wallet.
-   `Manta Wallet Extension`: The extension is a browser extension which generates zero knowledge proofs and manages the private keys of your UTXOs. The extension is open sourced and you find instruction to set it up locally at [manta-extension](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-extension).
-   `Manta Signer`: The signer is a desktop application which generates zero knowledge proofs and manages the private keys of your UTXOs. The signer is open sourced and you find instruction to set it up locally at [manta-signer](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-signer).
-   [zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) or the deprecated [polkadot-launch](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch) tool can help you set up a full relaychain + parachain network.
