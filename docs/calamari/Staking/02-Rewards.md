# Staking Rewards

Staking rewards work the following way:

1. On every produced block, 114 KMA are created (equivalent to 3% of total issuance per year)
2. This reward is split the following way
    - 10% of this reward go to the collator that produced it to compensate for collator running expenses
    - The remaining 90% is split proportionally to KMA staked between everyone who delegated to this collator (this includes a collatorâ€™s self-bond)

:::note
For 3 years, the inflation from 1. is countered by equivalent token burns from treasury
