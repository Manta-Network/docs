# Crowdloan

## What is a Crowdloan ?

Kusama is a network of blockchains that share consensus mechanisms for security and interoperability. Blockchains on the Kusama network are called parachains, and teams can win a spot for their blockchain by bidding in a parachain slot auction. Kusama allows teams to raise money for auctions through crowdloans from the community.


In a crowdloan, community contributers will lock up their own KSM or DOT until the end of a lease so a parachain team can bootstrap their parachain auction. (KSM are used for Kusama slots, and DOT for Polkadot slots). Teams can reward their contributors however they see fit, and can structure their crowdloan in various ways, hosting it either natively on Kusama (Polkadot) or on a 3rd-party platform.
