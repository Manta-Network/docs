# Crowdloan

## What is it ?
All Kusama parachains compete for the chance to launch a blockchain on Kusama by participating in a parachain slot auction. A parachain slot auction is when teams bid in an auction for the chance to win a slot to launch a blockchain on Kusama for security and interoperability. To help the team raise funds to participate in the auction, Kusama allows teams to launch a `crowdloan` in the community.


`Crowdloan` allows a team to crowdsource KSM (for Kusama slots) or DOT (for Polkadot slots) to use to bootstrap its parachain auction. So crowdloan allows people to contribute by agreeing to lock up their own KSM (DOT) until the end of the lease. Teams can reward their contributors however they see fit, and can structure their crowdloan in various ways, hosting it either natively on Kusama (Polkadot) or on a 3rd-party platform.
