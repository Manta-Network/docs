and auditable.

## About Calamari Token ($KMA)

The Initial Distribution of KMA is up to 10 billion tokens. $KMA is the first community-driven deflationary utility token where rebate rewards, redemption rewards, and token burns are generated from the Calamari privacy-preserving network usage. There will be no new token generation unless KMAs for the crowdloan are consumed.
The Calamari token ($KMA) is a utility token that rewards token holders with a rebate and redeems mechanism on MariPay and MariSwap usage fees. $KMA has a burn function for redemption. Moreover, $KMA also has governance and other extended functions.

## Calamari Token Distribution

KMA will be distributed in a community-driven method. The majority portion of KMA tokens will be owned by community members.
There is no team allocation; furthermore, there are no private rounds or private investors. The token's distribution will be a fair launch and favorable to early participants.

## Calamari Crownloan

On September 15, 2021, at 9:00 GMT, we secured parachain slot 7 after weeks of hard work from both the team and the community. Not only that, but we also broke the record for most contributors to a Kusama parachain auction â€” over 16,000 contributors to a single project!

## The Calamari Parachain

Calamari is Manta Network's canary-net, an early, highly experimental version of Manta Network, where all new features will be released and tested first. Calamari is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation parachain built to service the Kusama DeFi world. It combines Kusama and zkSNARKs to bring on-chain privacy to transactions and swaps.

In the early period, Calamari parachain will provide two products:

**MariPay:** a token-agnostic private payment service. MariPay supports the private transfer of Kusama and its Parachain assets, including significant crypto assets supported on Kusama. Users can transact popular assets like stablecoins and wrapped BTC while simultaneously benefiting from on-chain privacy through ZKP.

**MariSwap:** a private AMM-based DEX. MariSwap offers users the capability of swaps between parachain assets while preserving the privacy of the user addresses. It also provides never-before-seen features in the industry, such as private liquidity pools.
