## About Calamari Token ($KMA)

The Initial Distribution of KMA is up to 10 billion tokens. $KMA is the first community-driven deflationary utility token where rebate rewards, redemption rewards, and token burns are generated from the Calamari privacy-preserving network usage. There will be no new token generation unless KMAs for the crowdloan are consumed.
The Calamari token ($KMA) is a utility token that rewards token holders with a rebate and redeems mechanism on MariPay and MariSwap usage fees. $KMA has a burn function for redemption. Moreover, $KMA also has governance and other extended functions.

## Calamari Token Distribution

KMA will be distributed in a community-driven method. The majority portion of KMA tokens will be owned by community members.
There is no team allocation; furthermore, there are no private rounds or private investors. The token's distribution will be a fair launch and favorable to early participants.

## About Calamari PLO

Up to 3,000,000,000 (3 billion) KMAs, or 30%, of the total supply will be distributed to KSM contributors. Any unused KMA from the 30% allocation will be put directly towards the next parachain auction! The cap of Calamari's crowdloan will be 300,000 KSMs which means no more KMAs will be available for KSM contributors after the cap is reached.

## Unlocking the Full 3 billion KMA in Stages

For the Calamari crowdloan, the total allocation of 3 billion KMA will be distributed evenly over three stages (1 billion KMA unlocked per stage). Each new stage is unlocked if we don't win the auction slot. For example, stage 1 begins (1 billion KMA) with slot 6. If we don't win slot 6, stage 2 opens up (an additional 1 billion KMA) with slot seven auctions. If we don't win slot 7, then stage 3 opens up (an additional 1 billion KMA for a total of 3 billion in distribution). Stage 3 is the final unlock. In more details:

1. The first stage has a cap of 1 billion KMA for KSM contributors, which means a cap of 100,000 KSMs raised. If Calamari wins the auction during each stage, the remaining KMAs will go to the treasury for future auctions. Otherwise, the next stage opens up if we don't win the slot auction.

2. The second stage cap is 2 billion KMA and 200,000 KSM. If Calamari does not win the slot auction during this stage, it will go to the third stage.

3. In the third stage, 3 billion KMA will be distributed for a cap of 300,000 KSM.

## Bonuses for Contribution

Calamari crowdloan contributors will receive 10,000 KMAs per 1 KSM contributed as rewards for their contribution to the crowdloan by default. The fixed ratio guarantees that rewards for KSM contributors won't change with the amount of KSM Calamari raised. This makes it fair for all participants, regardless of when they enter.

That being said, we want to show our appreciation for the early supporters. To do that, we are offering early bonuses to the first 1,000 contributors on our crowdloan.

The first 500 contributors receive an extra 10% bonus, Calamari. For example, if Gabriela contributes 5 KSM, she receives 50,000 KMA by default. As one of the first 500 contributors, she receives an additional 10% bonus, or 5,000 KMA. In total, Sally receives 55,000 KMA as a reward for her early contribution.

The next 500 contributors receive an extra 5% bonus Calamari. For example, if Georgi contributes 5 KSM, he receives 50,000 KMA by default. As one of the contributors who are the first 501â€“1,000, he receives an additional 5% bonus, or 2,500 KMA. In total, Georgi receives 52,500 KMA as a reward for his early contribution.

## Referral Bonus

As a bonus, Calamari crowdloan contributors can also refer their friends and colleagues to participate in the Calamari crowdloan. Both the referrer and their referred counterparts receive a 2.5% bonus or 5% bonus in total split between the two.

For example, if Georgi refers Kevin, and Kevin contributes 10 KSM, he receives 100,000 KMA. Because Kevin used Georgi's referral code, Kevin received an additional 2.5% or 2,500 KMA for a total of 102,500 KMA. Georgi also receives an additional 2.5% calculated from Kevin's base contribution, or 2,500 KMA.

## The Calamari Parachain

Calamari is Manta Network's canary-net, an early, highly experimental version of Manta Network, where all new features will be released and tested first. Calamari is the plug-and-play privacy-preservation parachain built to service the Kusama DeFi world. It combines Kusama and zkSNARKs to bring on-chain privacy to transactions and swaps.

In the early period, Calamari parachain will provide two products:

**MariPay:** a token-agnostic private payment service. MariPay supports the private transfer of Kusama and its Parachain assets, including significant crypto assets supported on Kusama. Users can transact popular assets like stablecoins and wrapped BTC while simultaneously benefiting from on-chain privacy through ZKP.

**MariSwap:** a private AMM-based DEX. MariSwap offers users the capability of swaps between parachain assets while preserving the privacy of the user addresses. It also provides never-before-seen features in the industry, such as private liquidity pools.

Calamari will meet Kusama user's needs for on-chain privacy, anti-surveillance, and ensuring that private tokens are decentralized and interoperable. Calamari is currently a shell-chain.
