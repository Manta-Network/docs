# ðŸ›  Calamari SDK

## Introduction

The Calamari SDK is a JavaScript library that provides a connection to the Manta Network and its pallets such as MantaPay. MantaPay is a substrate-based pallet on Manta Network that allows users to send and receive fungible and non-fungible assets using MantaPayâ€™s private wallet SDK. The SDK provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with MantaPay's smart contracts and APIs.

It is recommended to use the MantaPay SDK instead of the PolkadotJS API directly. Using the SDK provides many benefits such as:

* Convenient and easy-to-use interface.
* Secure interactions with the blockchain.
* Built-in support for interacting with testnets.
* Built-in support for interacting with Manta's zero knowledge proof generation tool.
* Access to wallet features such as asset conversion, balance checks, and more.

To use the SDK, you will need to meet the following requirements:

* Have Manta Network's private wallet and signer (Manta-Signer) set up and running.
* Have access to a public wallet (such as the PolkadotJS or Metamask extension for web browsers).
* Have a node or browser version with the necessary dependencies.
* Have a Manta Network account.

## Network Endpoints

The API endpoints you can use to connect to production Calamari are as follows:

* Manta-provided: `wss://ws.calamari.systems`
* Third-party provided: `wss://calamari.api.onfinality.io`

If you need a testnet environment you can connect to Manta Network's public testnet called Dolphin:

* WSS - `wss://ws.calamari.seabird.systems`
* HTTPS - `https://rpc.calamari.seabird.systems`

## Asset API (Javascript)

The following is a list of assets and the API call to retrieve information about each asset:

* Token: `api.query.assets.account(asset_id, AccountId)`
- KMA: `api.query.system.account(AccountId)`
- KAR: `api.query.assets.account(8u128, AccountId)`
- AUSD: `api.query.assets.account(9u128, AccountId)`
- LKSM: `api.query.assets.account(10u128, AccountId)`
- MOVR: `api.query.assets.account(11u128, AccountId)`
- KSM: `api.query.assets.account(12u128, AccountId)`
- PHA: `api.query.assets.account(13u128, AccountId)`
* Note: In these examples asset-ids start from 8 to 13

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command:

```sh
yarn install manta.js
```

## Local Development

If you want to develop locally with the SDK, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Manta-Network/sdk.git`
2. Change to the package directory: `cd sdk/manta-js/package`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Build the package for either a browser or node.js environment:
    - For a browser: `yarn build`
    - For node.js: `yarn build-node`
5. Add the following line to your project's `package.json` file, replacing `<LOCAL PATH OF SDK>` with the local path to the SDK:
```json
"manta.js": "file:/<LOCAL PATH OF SDK>/manta-js/package"
```
6. Upgrade the SDK in your project directory: `yarn upgrade manta.js`

# Usage

All methods are called through the `MantaPrivateWallet` class.

Manta-signer must be installed and running. Refer to the [manta-signer section](#signer) for more details. If running `manta-signer` on dev mode, you should use the following features: `features=unsafe-disable-cors,disable-restart`.

Refer to [sdk/manta-js/examples](https://github.com/Manta-Network/sdk/tree/main/manta-js/examples/asset-webpack-ts#mantajs-examples) for more thorough examples, and how to run them.

## Node Specific

If running in node.js the wasm module assumes browser DOM exists, you must export Web API functions from node in your project as seen below.

```javascript
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

// @ts-ignore
global.fetch = fetch;
// @ts-ignore
global.Headers = fetch.Headers;
// @ts-ignore
global.Request = fetch.Request;
// @ts-ignore
global.Response = fetch.Response;
```

## Getting Started With Manta.js

`Manta.js` is a library that helps you connect to and interact with the Polkadot network. To get started with Manta.js, you'll need to specify the `Environment` and `Network` you want to connect to.

The Environment flag specifies whether to connect to a local node (`ws://127.0.0.1:9944`), or the use an actual node from the specified network.

The `Network` flag specifies which network to connect to, either `Dolphin`, `Calamari` or `Manta`.

### Setting Up `MantaPrivateWallet`

To connect to a specific environment and network, you'll need to create a new instance of the `MantaPrivateWallet` class. To switch between environments and networks, simply create a new instance.

Here's an example of how to create a `MantaPrivateWallet` instance for the production environment and the Calamari network:

```javascript
import { MantaPrivateWallet, Environment, Network } from 'manta.js';

const prodEnvironment = sdk.Environment.Production;
const calamariNetwork = sdk.Network.Calamari;

const privateWalletConfig: PrivateWalletConfig = {
    environment: prodEnvironment,
    network: calamariNetwork,
};

const privateWallet = await MantaPrivateWallet.init(privateWalletConfig);
```

### Configuring The Wallet

`PrivateWalletConfig` has several optional arguments:

- `loggingEnabled`, whether or not non-error logging to console should occur, set by default to `false`.
- `maxSendersPullSize`, set by default to `4096`.
- `maxReceiversPullSize`, set by default to `4096`.
- `pullCallback`, callback function after a pull has occured, set by default to `null`.
- `errorCallback`, callback function after an error has occured, set by default to `null`.

## Making A Transaction

Before you can make transactions, you'll need to call the `initialWalletSync()` method on your `MantaPrivateWallet` instance. This will sync your wallet with the latest data from the ledger.

After every single transaction, you'll need to call the `walletSync()` method to get the latest data from the ledger.
### Polkadot JS Transaction Parameters

Before making any transactions, you need to obtain the Polkadot JS `Signer` and `Address`. To do so, you need to have the PolkadotJS extension installed in your browser. You can use the following code to get the values:

```javascript
import { web3Accounts, web3Enable, web3FromSource } from '@polkadot/extension-dapp';

const getPolkadotSignerAndAddress = async () => {
    await web3Enable('Polkadot App');
    const allAccounts = await web3Accounts();
    if (allAccounts.length === 0) {
        throw new Error("PolkadotJS browser extension missing. Please visit https://polkadot.js.org/extension/ to install it.");
    }

    const account = allAccounts[0];
    const injector = await web3FromSource(account.meta.source);
    const polkadotSigner = injector.signer;
    const polkadotAddress = account.address;

    return {
        polkadotSigner,
        polkadotAddress
    };
};
```

To transact using fungible tokens, manta-pay provides 4 methods:

* `toPrivateSend(asset, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
* `privateTransferSend(asset, amount, receiver, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
* `toPublicSend(asset, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
* `publicTransfer(asset, amount, destinationAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress)`
Note: The polkadotAddress should already have associated public funds.

### Converting Public Tokens To Private Tokens

This example converts 10 public KMA tokens to 10 zkKMA tokens.

```javascript
// Identify the KMA token with an asset ID
const assetId = new BN("1");

// Define the amount to convert, 10 KMA tokens
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

// Synchronize with the latest ledger state
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get the private address
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Get the balance of zkKMA tokens for the given private address
const privateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);

// Convert 10 public KMA tokens to 10 zkKMA tokens
await privateWallet.toPrivateSend(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Synchronize again to check if the transaction was successful
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// Check the updated private balance of zkKMA tokens
const newPrivateBalance = await mantaSdk.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### Transferring Private Tokens

This example transfers 10 zkKMA to another address.

```javascript
// Identify the KMA token with an asset ID
const assetId = new BN("1");

// Define the amount to transfer, 10 zkKMA tokens
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

// Synchronize with the latest ledger state
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get the private address
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Define the recipient private address
const examplePrivateAddress = "3UG1BBvv7viqwyg1QKsMVarnSPcdiRQ1aL2vnTgwjWYX";

// Transfer 10 zkKMA tokens to another private address
await privateWallet.privateTransferSend(assetId, amount, examplePrivateAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Synchronize again to check if the transaction was successful
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// Check the updated private balance of zkKMA tokens
const newPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### To Public

This example converts 5 zkKMA to 5 public KMA.

```javascript
// Define the KMA token with asset ID "1".
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("5000000000000");

// Sync the private wallet with the latest ledger state.
await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

// Get the private address of the wallet.
const privateAddress = await privateWallet.getPrivateAddress();

// Check the current private balance of zkKMA for the private address.
const privateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);

// Convert 5 zkKMA to 5 public KMA tokens.
await privateWallet.toPublicSend(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

// Sync the wallet again to get the latest data after the transaction and verify it was successful.
await privateWallet.walletSync();

// The private balance of zkKMA should now be 5 units less.
const newPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.getPrivateBalance(assetId);
```

### Manta Utilities

The `MantaUtilities` class provides additional functions for interacting publicly with the Manta ecosystem. This example demonstrates these functions. It assumes that the `MantaPrivateWallet` class has already been initialized, as well as `polkadotAddress` and `polkadotSigner`.

```javascript
import { MantaUtilities } from "manta.js";

// Get the version of the signer, it must be running.
const signerVersion = await MantaUtilities.getSignerVersion();

// Define the KMA token with asset ID "1".
const assetId = new BN("1");

// Check the current public balance of KMA for the `polkadotAddress`.
const oldPublicBalance = await MantaUtilities.getPublicBalance(privateWallet.api, assetId, polkadotAddress);

// Transfer 5 public KMA to another public address.
const destinationAddress = "dmyhNmYL13N7ZKcVYqBQhvrk5kSfrKZUmrjX9vAaM4846bWKR";
const amount = new BN("5000000000000000000");
await MantaUtilities.publicTransfer(privateWallet.api, assetId, amount, destinationAddress, polkadotAddress, polkadotSigner);

// The public balance should now be 5 KMA less than the old public balance.
const newPublicBalance = await MantaUtilities.getPublicBalance(privateWallet.api, assetId, polkadotAddress);
```

### Sign and manually send transaction

Sometimes, you may want to sign a transaction without sending it automatically to the ledger via manta.js. In this case, you can use the `toPrivateBuild`, `privateTransferBuild`, or `publicTransferBuild` functions.

Here is a code example of how to sign a `toPrivate` transaction for 10 KMA:

```javascript
const assetId = new BN("1");
const amount = new BN("10000000000000");

const env = sdk.Environment.Production;
const net = sdk.Network.Calamari;
const privateWallet = await sdk.init(env,net);

const privateAddress = await privateWallet.privateAddress();
console.log("The private address is: ", privateAddress);

await privateWallet.initialWalletSync();

const initialPrivateBalance = await privateWallet.privateBalance(assetId);
console.log("The initial private balance is: ", initialPrivateBalance.toString());

const signResult = await privateWallet.toPrivateBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);

console.log("The result of the signing: ", JSON.stringify(signResult.transactions));
```

This can also be done for all other transaction types:

```javascript
const toPrivateSignResult = await privateWallet.toPrivateBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
const toPublicSignResult = await privateWallet.toPublicBuild(assetId, amount, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
const privateTransferSignResult = await privateWallet.privateTransferBuild(assetId, amount, privateAddress, polkadotSigner, polkadotAddress);
```

Once you have the signed transaction, you can submit it yourself. To verify the signed transaction, you can follow these steps:

Copy the transaction to polkadot.js `Extrinsic` decode:

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_decode.png)

Switch to `Submission`:

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_extrinsic.png)

Then submit transaction.

![extrinsic decode](../images/to_private_submit.png)

You should see your extrinsic show up on polkadot.js explorer. Then you will notice an increase in your private balance.

## Manta Signer

`Manta Signer` is a desktop application that generates zero-knowledge proofs for `MantaPay` transactions and manages the private keys of your UTXOs. The signer is open-source and you can find instructions on how to set it up on the [manta-signer](https://github.com/Manta-Network/manta-signer).

To get started, you need to install `tauri-cli` and build the signer using `cargo tauri build`. Then, run the signer and create your private address by following the prompts.
If you do not need to interact with the signer directly, you can run a simple test server with `cargo run --example test_server --features=unsafe-disable-cors,disable-restart --release`.
