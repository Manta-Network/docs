# Calamari Network Roadmap

Calamari Network is Manta Network’s canary network deployment of its privacy protocol. Calamari will exist on the Kusama network. As the canary network deployment, the Manta Network ecosystem envisions cooperation where Calamari Network will always receive the latest features, ready to deploy for live use but before being deployed on Manta Network. In other words, Calamari Network will receive the latest new features before Manta Network does.

This gives Manta Network a unique opportunity to battle-test features and gauges greater user response before implementing them on the main network. That being said, given that the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems continue to diverge, we want to keep our minds open to the possibility of Calamari Network developing into possibly its product, with features that may not necessarily match those of Manta Network. For example, some features that make it on to Calamari Network may not make their way into Manta Network.

In the current state of development for Calamari Network, our primary focus is to create a canary network that would align with the future deployment roadmap of calamarManta Network. With that in mind, the core development team has created a roadmap of features that we want to focus on before and after the Calamari Network launch once we secure a parachain slot auction. We intend to go for parachain slots 6–10, which are coming up soon (at the time of writing).

# The Categories of Focus

Within the Calamari Network Roadmap, we focus and execute three main categories: the Kusama Parachain Auction, On-chain Governance, and general Calamari Features/Tasks. Each category is filled with subtasks, which helps us organize and plan for the different factors we need to consider for a successful parachain launch.

## The Kusama Parachain Auction

The first major category we are very mindful of is the Kusama Parachain Auction. It outlines all of the tasks that must be complete before and immediately after winning a parachain auction. We intend to begin our PLO once slot auction 6 begins. We have already released our Calamari PLO strategy. We will need to publish the chain genesis with the auction, and the ultimate goal is to win a parachain slot.

## On-Chain Governance

With the launch of our network, we need to shift the project into one that is community-led. This means that the Manta Network core development team will have no special privilege in implementing or removing any features without community consent. We are prioritizing on-chain governance and intend to have it at an early stage with Calamari Network. Therefore, it is a task that we are categorizing and prioritizing for the Calamari Network launch.

## General Calamari

General Calamari tasks include all of the tasks we need to build in as features and technologies for the underlying Calamari network to operate. This includes tasks such as:

1. Creating the frontend so that users have a simple web interface to transact parachain assets privately.

2. MariPay/KSM integration to enable private transacting of KSM.

3. Community Trusted Setup to launch the ZKP circuit.

These are all tasks that must accomplish to launch the entirety of Calamari version 1 successfully.

## Next Steps for Calamari Network

As a next step, we are going to participate in the Kusama Network parachain auctions. Starting on slot 6, we intend to go for our first parachain.

Furthermore, we have some very exciting news to reveal to the community alongside the Calamari Network PLO in the upcoming weeks. While we can’t disclose the information just yet, you can be the first to know by signing up for our Calamari Crowdloan newsletter.
