# The Ultimate Guide to Manta Interoperability

Manta Network initially started its journey with Manta Atlantic (the fastest ZK L1 chain on Polkadot) and later introduced Manta Pacific (the modular L2 ecosystem that is community-driven) in the Manta ecosystem.

To ensure seamless participation from the Manta ecosystem users, assets should circulate freely within both chains, especially the native governance token, $MANTA. Users can use tokens on both chains to participate in Manta Pacific’s fast-growing ecosystem (DeFi, SocialFi, zkApps & more) by enjoying the inexpensive gas fees & highly scalable environment. Meanwhile, on Manta Atlantic, users can use $MANTA for gas fees to participate in staking and other on-chain activities.

The cBridge cross-chain bridge powered by Celer enables a seamless bridging experience between Manta Pacific and Atlantic. The bridge will go live at TGE on January 18, 2024.

## Bridge and Lockup

Manta bridge and stake functions on Atlantic will be live at TGE. For token holders of $MANTA on Manta Pacific, you can bridge to Manta Atlantic to stake and interact with the Atlantic ecosystem.

## Bridging $MANTA between Pacific and Atlantic

-   Make sure you have enough tokens to pay gas fees: $MANTA in your Manta Atlantic wallet, and $ETH in your Manta Pacific wallet. If you don’t have an Atlantic wallet yet, you can download a compatible wallet such as the Manta Wallet. Once you have your Atlantic wallet, you can use the address located in it.
-   Bridge $MANTA from Manta Pacific to Manta Atlantic by using the Manta Bridge.
-   Connect both your Atlantic wallet (e.g., Manta Wallet) and your Pacific wallet (e.g., MetaMask) on cBridge. Then, select the token you are bridging (i.e., $MANTA) and enter the amount you want to bridge.
-   Approve the transaction to initiate the transfer process.

-   Bridge $MANTA between Moonbean to Manta Pacific by using Celer’s cBridge.
-   Connect both your Atlantic wallet (e.g., Manta Wallet) and your Pacific wallet (e.g., MetaMask) on cBridge. Choose which network you want to bridge from (e.g., Manta Pacific) and which network you want to bridge to (e.g., Manta Atlantic). Then, select the token you are bridging (i.e., $MANTA) and enter the amount you want to bridge.

## Notes

-   If you need to manually update Manta Wallet, open the Chrome extension, enable developer mode in the top-right corner, and click ‘Update’ in the top-left corner.
-   If you participated in Squad Game (the Manta Network Crowdsale), your $MANTA tokens will appear in your Manta Atlantic network wallet.
-   When transferring to centralized exchanges, please make sure to double check the network address. Manta Pacific addresses begin with prefix 0x.
-   The Polkadot XCM bridge is used from Manta Atlantic to Moonbeam, and the Bridge by Celer is used from Moonbeam to Manta Pacific.
