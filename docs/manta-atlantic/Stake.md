-   First, if you don’t have a Manta Atlantic-compatible wallet yet, you can add the Manta Wallet Chrome extension or another wallet supporting Manta Atlantic.
-   Follow the steps in the Manta Wallet extension to create a new account. Don’t forget to back up your mnemonic phrase in a safe place!
-   After completing your wallet setup, make sure to fund it with $MANTA. Then head over to the Collator website on Manta Atlantic to select a collator to stake your assets. Please bear in mind that each collator can only take a total of 100 wallets. After that amount, only the top 100 wallets (ranked by the amount of $MANTA contributed) will earn rewards.
-   You can always check your rewards after connecting your wallet to the Manta Collator website and checking at the top of the page.
