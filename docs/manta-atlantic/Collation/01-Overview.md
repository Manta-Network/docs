# ðŸ§© Overview

Node maintainers are encouraged and welcome to run Manta collators. No centralized permission is required but a MANTA bond must be posted.

Free-Market competition between high-performing collators for delegations will ensure a Manta Network runs at maximum performance and censorship resistance.

## Benefits of Running a Collator

-   Participation in staking rewards
-   Boosted APY compared to delegation through 10% commision on delegator's share of rewards
-   10% of transaction fees in every block produced by the collator
-   2% of the total supply goes directly to block producers on an annual basis.
