# Manta Collator Docs

ðŸ§© Overview

Node maintainers are encouraged and welcome to run Manta collators. No centralized permission is required but a MANTA bond must be posted.

Free-Market competition between high-performing collators for delegations will ensure a Manta Network runs at maximum performance and censorship resistance.
